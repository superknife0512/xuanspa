Facial massages increase circulation to your facial tissue, resulting in brighter,
youthful-looking skin. Facial massages can also help to lift and firm the skin,
reducing the appearance of puffiness and wrinkles. As an added benefit, a good
facial massage reduces stress, leaving you feeling peaceful and relaxed. Treat
yourself to a massage once a day, either in the morning or at night before you go
to sleep.;;
